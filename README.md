# Standard Template Construct

Welcome, developer! You've reached the repository for STC, a distributed,
replicable data system offering free access to academic knowledge and works of fictional literature.
STC operates on [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/), a distributed system that ensures the reliable storage
of STC's datasets across numerous participants. 

Essentially, STC is a search engine paired with data banks, designed for easy duplication.
Several auxiliary projects exist alongside STC to guarantee its accessibility to diverse users:

- [GECK](/geck) is a Python library and Bash tool for interacting with STC programmatically.
- [Cybrex AI](/cybrex) library pairs STC with AI tools such as OpenAI for processing stored data
- [Telegram Nexus Bot](/tgbot) allows users to access STC via Telegram, one of the most popular messaging platforms.
- [Web STC](/web) is a web-based search engine that can be entirely constructed and deployed on IPFS.
